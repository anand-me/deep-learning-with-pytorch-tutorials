| Tutorial | Open in Colab |
|----------|---------------|
| 1. Introduction to Tensors | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/anand-me/deep-learning-with-pytorch-tutorials/blob/main/src/PyTorchTuto_1.ipynb) |
| 2. Autograd and Automatic Differentiation | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/anand-me/deep-learning-with-pytorch-tutorials/blob/main/src/PyTorchTuto_2.ipynb) |
| 3. Neural Networks with PyTorch | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/anand-me/deep-learning-with-pytorch-tutorials/blob/main/src/PyTorchTuto_3.ipynb) |
| 4. Training Models | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/anand-me/deep-learning-with-pytorch-tutorials/blob/main/src/PyTorchTuto_4.ipynb) |
| 5. Saving and Loading Models | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/anand-me/deep-learning-with-pytorch-tutorials/blob/main/src/PyTorchTuto_5.ipynb) |

Running in Colab gives you:
- Free GPU/TPU access
- No local setup required
- Easy sharing and collaboration

### Option 2: Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anand-me/deep-learning-with-pytorch-tutorials.git
   cd deep-learning-with-pytorch-tutorials
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

## üì¶ Installation Requirements

To ensure a smooth experience, this repository includes both `requirements.txt` and environment YAML files for flexible setup options:

### Option 1: Using pip
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Using conda
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pytorch-tutorials
```
